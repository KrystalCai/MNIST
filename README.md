# MNIST Classification in R

## Project Overview
This project implements a handwritten digit classification model using the MNIST dataset in R. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify digits from 0 to 9. The project focuses on:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Calculation of evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score

All code is contained in the `MNIST.R` script.
